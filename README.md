# WindowCapture2D

## Overview
WindowCapture2D is an Unreal Engine plugin that enables low-latency, high-performance window-based capture on Windows.

It supports capturing background windows, and the captured images can be attached to meshes or UMG in 3D space.

**If you want to confirm whether this plugin works in your environment, you can download the Tester application from the Releases of this repository and check if the capture works correctly.**

// ... Release with Dispose() when done
Capture->Dispose();
```

## Notes
- Does not work on environments other than Windows.
- Capturing windows displayed on large screens such as 4K monitors requires a high-performance CPU and GPU.
  - If the frame rate is low, please lower the screen resolution.
- Some types of windows may not be capturable.

## WinRT
This plugin uses WinRT to capture windows.

Therefore, to build this plugin in your environment, Windows SDK v10.0.22000.0 or later is required.

Additionally, this plugin includes the WinRT headers within the Plugin directory and uses them via include.

This is because, in rare cases where an older version of WinRT is present in the environment, building the plugin may fail.

If you want to build using the WinRT installed in your environment, please modify the following line in `WindowCapture2D.Build.cs` to add the directory on your system to the include path.

```csharp
var winrtDirectory = Path.Combine(ModuleDirectory, "Private", "cppwinrt");
if (Directory.Exists(winrtDirectory))
{
    PrivateIncludePaths.Add(winrtDirectory);
}
```
